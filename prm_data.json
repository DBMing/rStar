        "response": "Step 1: <Action 1> Defining Function Structures Using pseudocode  \nWe start by defining the overall structure of the function `find_min_max_sum_digits`. This function will take three integers `l`, `d`, and `x` as inputs, and it will return a list containing the minimal integer `n` and the maximal integer `m` such that `l \u2264 n \u2264 d` and the sum of its digits equals `x`.  \n[Pseudo Start]  \n```\nFunction find_min_max_sum_digits(l, d, x):\n    Initialize n as None\n    Initialize m as None\n    \n    For i from l to d:\n        If sum_of_digits(i) equals x:\n            If n is None:\n                Set n to i\n            Set m to i\n            \n    Return [n, m]\n    \nFunction sum_of_digits(num):\n    Initialize total as 0\n    While num > 0:\n        total += num % 10\n        num = num // 10\n    Return total\n[Pseudo End]  \n```\n\nStep 2: <Action 2> Refine part of the pseudocode  \nLet's refine the pseudocode to improve clarity and ensure the digit sum function is clearly defined. We will define the `sum_of_digits` function to handle digit extraction and summation properly.  \n[Pseudo Start]  \n```\nFunction find_min_max_sum_digits(l, d, x):\n    Initialize n as None\n    Initialize m as None\n    \n    For i from l to d:\n        If sum_of_digits(i) equals x:\n            If n is None:\n                Set n to i  // Found the minimum n\n            Set m to i  // Update m to the current i (maximal)\n            \n    Return [n, m]\n\nFunction sum_of_digits(num):\n    Initialize total as 0\n    While num > 0:\n        total += num mod 10  // Add the last digit to total\n        num = num // 10      // Remove the last digit\n    Return total\n[Pseudo End]  \n```\n\nStep 3: <Action 2> Refine part of the pseudocode  \nWe will refine the loop in the `find_min_max_sum_digits` function to ensure that it efficiently checks each integer from `l` to `d`, and clearly defines when the minimal `n` and maximal `m` are set. We will also ensure that the digit sum function is invoked correctly within the loop.  \n[Pseudo Start]  \n```\nFunction find_min_max_sum_digits(l, d, x):\n    Initialize n as None\n    Initialize m as None\n    \n    For i from l to d:  // Iterate through each number in the range\n        If sum_of_digits(i) equals x:  // Check if the sum of digits equals x\n            If n is None:  // If n is not set yet, this is the minimum\n                Set n to i\n            Set m to i  // Update m to the current value of i (maximal)\n    \n    Return [n, m]  // Return the found values of n and m\n\nFunction sum_of_digits(num):\n    Initialize total as 0\n    While num > 0:  // Continue until there are no digits left\n        total += num mod 10  // Add the last digit to total\n        num = num // 10      // Remove the last digit\n    Return total  // Return the calculated digit sum\n[Pseudo End]  \n```\n\nStep 4: <Action 3> Generate python code from the pseudocode  \nNow that the pseudocode is fully refined, we can convert it into working Python code that implements the logic described above. This will ensure that the function `find_min_max_sum_digits` correctly computes the minimal and maximal integers whose digit sums equal `x`.  \nThe code is: [Code Start]\n```python\ndef find_min_max_sum_digits(l, d, x):\n    def sum_of_digits(num):\n        total = 0\n        while num > 0:\n            total += num % 10\n            num = num // 10\n        return total\n\n    n = None\n    m = None\n    \n    for i in range(l, d + 1):\n        if sum_of_digits(i) == x:\n            if n is None:\n                n = i  # Found the minimum n\n            m = i  # Update m to the current i (maximal)\n    \n    return [n, m]\n\n# Example usage\nl = 100\nd = 200\nx = 10\nprint(find_min_max_sum_digits(l, d, x))  # Output: [109, 190]\n```\n[Code End]",

This will include defining the main function `find_min_max_sum_digits` and the helper function `sum_of_digits`.  \nThe code is: [Code Start]\n```python\ndef find_min_max_sum_digits(l, d, x):\n    def sum_of_digits(num):\n        total = 0\n        while num > 0:\n            total += num % 10\n            num //= 10\n        return total\n\n    n = None  # To hold the minimal integer\n    m = None  # To hold the maximal integer\n    \n    for i in range(l, d + 1):  # Iterate from l to d inclusive\n        if sum_of_digits(i) == x:  # Check if the sum of digits equals x\n            if n is None:  # First valid number found\n                n = i  # Assign to n\n            m = i  # Always update m to the latest valid number\n            \n    return [n, m]  # Return the results as a list\n```\n[Code End]",

        "response": "Step 1: <Action 1> Defining Function Structures Using pseudocode  \nWe start by defining the overall structure of the function `find_min_max_numbers`. This function will take three integers `l`, `d`, and `x` as inputs. It will return an array containing the minimal integer `n` and the maximal integer `m` that satisfy the given conditions regarding their digit sums.  \n[Pseudo Start]  \n```\nFunction find_min_max_numbers(l, d, x):\n    Initialize min_number to None\n    Initialize max_number to None\n    \n    For n in range(l, d + 1):\n        If sum_of_digits(n) equals x:\n            If min_number is None:\n                Set min_number to n\n            Set max_number to n\n            \n    Return [min_number, max_number]\n    \nFunction sum_of_digits(n):\n    Initialize sum to 0\n    While n > 0:\n        Add (n % 10) to sum\n        Divide n by 10\n    Return sum\n[Pseudo End]  \n```\n\nStep 2: <Action 2> Refine part of the pseudocode  \nLet's refine the `find_min_max_numbers` function by ensuring it clearly initializes the variables for tracking the minimum and maximum numbers correctly. We will also ensure that the condition for updating the maximum number is clear and efficient.  \n[Pseudo Start]  \n```\nFunction find_min_max_numbers(l, d, x):\n    Initialize min_number to None\n    Initialize max_number to None\n    \n    For n in range(l, d + 1):\n        If sum_of_digits(n) equals x:\n            If min_number is None:\n                Set min_number to n\n            Set max_number to n  // Always update max_number if the condition is met\n            \n    Return [min_number, max_number]\n    \nFunction sum_of_digits(n):\n    Initialize sum to 0\n    While n > 0:\n        Add (n % 10) to sum\n        Divide n by 10\n    Return sum\n[Pseudo End]  \n```\n\nStep 3: <Action 2> Refine part of the pseudocode  \nLet's further refine the pseudocode by improving the clarity of the `sum_of_digits` function and ensuring all operations are well-defined. We will also clarify the logic in the `find_min_max_numbers` function.  \n[Pseudo Start]  \n```\nFunction find_min_max_numbers(l, d, x):\n    Initialize min_number to None\n    Initialize max_number to None\n    \n    For n in range(l, d + 1):\n        If sum_of_digits(n) equals x:\n            If min_number is None:  // First valid number found\n                Set min_number to n\n            // Update max_number every time a valid number is found\n            Set max_number to n  \n            \n    Return [min_number, max_number]\n    \nFunction sum_of_digits(n):\n    Initialize sum to 0\n    While n > 0:\n        Add (n % 10) to sum  // Extract the last digit\n        Divide n by 10  // Remove the last digit\n    Return sum\n[Pseudo End]  \n```\n\nStep 4: <Action 3> Generate python code from the pseudocode  \nWe can now translate the refined pseudocode into working Python code. This will involve implementing the `find_min_max_numbers` function along with the `sum_of_digits` helper function to find the minimum and maximum integers that satisfy the digit sum condition.  \nThe code is: [Code Start]\n```python\ndef find_min_max_numbers(l, d, x):\n    min_number = None\n    max_number = None\n    \n    for n in range(l, d + 1):\n        if sum_of_digits(n) == x:\n            if min_number is None:  # First valid number found\n                min_number = n\n            max_number = n  # Update max_number every time a valid number is found\n            \n    return [min_number, max_number]\n\ndef sum_of_digits(n):\n    total = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        total += (n % 10)  # Extract the last digit\n        n //= 10  # Remove the last digit\n    return total\n\n# Example usage:\nl = 100\nd = 200\nx = 10\nresult = find_min_max_numbers(l, d, x)\nprint(result)  # Output: [109, 190]\n```\n[Code End]",
