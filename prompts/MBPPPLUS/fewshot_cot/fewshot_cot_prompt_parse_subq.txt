### Instruction:
Write a function to convert a roman numeral to an integer.

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Subquestion: What are the basic rules for converting Roman numerals to integers?
Subanswer: Roman numerals are represented by combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet. The basic rules include:I (1), V (5), X (10), L (50), C (100), D (500), M (1000). When a smaller numeral appears before a larger numeral, it is subtracted. When a smaller numeral appears after a larger numeral, it is added. A numeral should not be repeated more than three times consecutively.The answer is: smaller before larger subtracts, smaller after larger adds, and no more than three consecutive repetitions.
Subquestion: How can we implement these rules in a Python function?
Subanswer: We can create a dictionary to map Roman numerals to their integer values. Then, we can iterate through the Roman numeral string, applying the rules to calculate the integer value. The answer is: use a dictionary for mappings and iterate through the string applying the rules.
Subquestion: Now we can answer the question: How to write a Python function to convert a Roman numeral to an integer?
Subanswer: We can write a function in Python that takes a Roman numeral string as input and returns the corresponding integer value.

### Instruction:
Write a python function to find the average of a list.

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Subquestion: What is the formula for calculating the average of a list of numbers?
Subanswer: The average of a list of numbers is calculated by summing all the numbers in the list and then dividing the sum by the number of elements in the list. The answer is: sum of numbers divided by the count of numbers.
Subquestion: How can we implement this formula in a Python function?
Subanswer: We can write a function that takes a list of numbers as input, calculates the sum of the numbers, counts the number of elements in the list, and then returns the average by dividing the sum by the count. The answer is: use the sum() function and len() function.
Subquestion: Now we can answer the question: How to write a Python function to find the average of a list?
Subanswer: We can write a function in Python that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average of the numbers.
