This function will take the number of boards `n`, the number of painters `k`, and the array `arr` of board lengths as inputs. It will return the minimum time required to paint all the boards. We'll also define a helper function `numofPainter` within it to determine the number of painters needed for a given maximum length of boards that can be painted by one painter.\n\n[Pseudo Start]  \n```\nFunction minTime(arr, n, k):\n    Define helper function numofPainter(maxLen):\n        Initialize painters to 1\n        Initialize total to 0\n        Loop over each board in arr:\n            Update total with the board length\n            If total exceeds maxLen:\n                Reset total to current board length\n                Increment painters\n        Return painters\n    \n    Initialize low as maximum value in arr\n    Initialize high as sum of all elements in arr\n    While low is less than high:\n        Compute middle point p\n        Calculate current painters using numofPainter with p\n        If current painters is less than or equal to k:\n            Update high to p\n        Else:\n            Update low to p + 1\n    Return low\n[Pseudo End]  \n```\n\nStep 2: <Action 2> Refine part of the pseudocode  \nWe'll refine the `numofPainter` function to ensure it correctly calculates the number of painters required, given a constraint on the maximum length of boards one painter can handle. This function should iterate over the board lengths and accumulate the total until it exceeds `maxLen`, at which point we increment the painter count.\n\n[Pseudo Start]  \n```\nFunction minTime(arr, n, k):\n    Define helper function numofPainter(maxLen):\n        Set painters to 1\n        Set total to 0\n        For each board in arr:\n            Add board to total\n            If total is greater than maxLen:\n                Set total to board\n                Increase painters by 1\n        Return painters\n    \n    Set low to max(arr)\n    Set high to sum(arr)\n    While low is less than high:\n        Set p to low + (high - low) // 2\n        Set curr_painters to numofPainter(p)\n        If curr_painters <= k:\n            Set high to p\n        Else:\n            Set low to p + 1\n    Return low\n[Pseudo End]  \n```\n\nStep 3: <Action 2> Refine part of the pseudocode  \nWe refine the binary search logic to correctly adjust the range (`low` and `high`) based on whether the current number of painters `curr_painters` is within the allowed number of painters `k`. This ensures that we're narrowing down to the minimum possible time required.\n\n[Pseudo Start]  \n```\nFunction minTime(arr, n, k):\n    Define helper function numofPainter(maxLen):\n        Initialize painters to 1\n        Initialize total to 0\n        For each board in arr:\n            Add board to total\n            If total exceeds maxLen:\n                Set total to board\n                Increment painters\n        Return painters\n    \n    Set low to max(arr)\n    Set high to sum(arr)\n    While low is less than high:\n        Calculate p as low + (high - low) // 2\n        Calculate curr_painters using numofPainter(p)\n        If curr_painters <= k:\n            Set high to p\n        Else:\n            Set low to p + 1\n    Return low\n[Pseudo End]  \n```\n\nStep 4: <Action 3> Generate python code from the pseudocode  \nThe pseudocode is now sufficiently detailed, and we can translate it into the final Python code. This will involve implementing the `minTime` function with the `numofPainter` helper function and using binary search to find the minimum time.\n\nThe code is:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n\n    def minTime(self, arr, n, k):\n\n        def numofPainter(maxLen):\n            painters = 1\n            total = 0\n            for board in arr:\n                total += board\n                if total > maxLen:\n                    total = board\n                    painters += 1\n            return painters\n\n        low, high = max(arr), sum(arr)\n        while low < high:\n            p = low + (high - low) // 2\n            curr_painters = numofPainter(p)\n            if curr_painters <= k:\n                high = p\n            else:\n                low = p + 1\n        return low\n```",

        "question": "# Esolang Interpreters #3 - Custom Paintfuck Interpreter\n\n## About this Kata Series\n\n\"Esolang Interpreters\" is a Kata Series that originally began as three separate, independent esolang interpreter Kata authored by [@donaldsebleung](http://codewars.com/users/donaldsebleung) which all shared a similar format and were all somewhat inter-related.  Under the influence of [a fellow Codewarrior](https://www.codewars.com/users/nickkwest), these three high-level inter-related Kata gradually evolved into what is known today as the \"Esolang Interpreters\" series.\n\nThis series is a high-level Kata Series designed to challenge the minds of bright and daring programmers by implementing interpreters for various [esoteric programming languages/Esolangs](http://esolangs.org), mainly [Brainfuck](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) derivatives but not limited to them, given a certain specification for a certain Esolang.  Perhaps the only exception to this rule is the very first Kata in this Series which is intended as an introduction/taster to the world of esoteric programming languages and writing interpreters for them.\n\n## The Language\n\nPaintfuck is a [borderline-esoteric programming language/Esolang](http://esolangs.org) which is a derivative of [Smallfuck](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Smallfuck) (itself a derivative of the famous [Brainfuck](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck)) that uses a two-dimensional data grid instead of a one-dimensional tape.\n\nValid commands in Paintfuck include:\n\n- `n` - Move data pointer north (up)\n- `e` - Move data pointer east (right)\n- `s` - Move data pointer south (down)\n- `w` - Move data pointer west (left)\n- `*` - Flip the bit at the current cell (same as in Smallfuck)\n- `[` - Jump past matching `]` if bit under current pointer is `0` (same as in Smallfuck)\n- `]` - Jump back to the matching `[` (if bit under current pointer is nonzero) (same as in Smallfuck)\n\nThe specification states that any non-command character (i.e. any character other than those mentioned above) should simply be ignored.  The output of the interpreter is the two-dimensional data grid itself, best as animation as the interpreter is running, but at least a representation of the data grid itself after a certain number of iterations (explained later in task).\n\nIn current implementations, the 2D datagrid is finite in size with toroidal (wrapping) behaviour.  This is one of the few major differences of Paintfuck from Smallfuck as Smallfuck terminates (normally) whenever the pointer exceeds the bounds of the tape.\n\nSimilar to Smallfuck, Paintfuck is Turing-complete **if and only if** the 2D data grid/canvas were unlimited in size.  However, since the size of the data grid is defined to be finite, it acts like a finite state machine.\n\nMore info on this Esolang can be found [here](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Paintfuck).\n\n## The Task\n\nYour task is to implement a custom Paintfuck interpreter `interpreter()`/`Interpret` which accepts the following arguments in the specified order:\n\n1. `code` - **Required**.  The Paintfuck code to be executed, passed in as a string.  May contain comments (non-command characters), in which case your interpreter should simply ignore them.  If empty, simply return the initial state of the data grid.\n2. `iterations` - **Required**.  A non-negative integer specifying the number of iterations to be performed before the final state of the data grid is returned.  See notes for definition of 1 iteration.  If equal to zero, simply return the initial state of the data grid.\n3. `width` - **Required**.  The width of the data grid in terms of the number of data cells in each row, passed in as a positive integer.\n4. `height` - **Required**.  The height of the data grid in cells (i.e. number of rows) passed in as a positive integer.\n\nA few things to note:\n\n- Your interpreter should treat all command characters as **case-sensitive** so `N`, `E`, `S` and `W` are **not** valid command characters\n- Your interpreter should initialize all cells within the data grid to a value of `0` regardless of the width and height of the grid\n- In this implementation, your pointer must always start at the **top-left hand corner** of the data grid (i.e. first row, first column).  This is important as some implementations have the data pointer starting at the middle of the grid.\n- One iteration is defined as one step in the program, i.e. the number of command characters evaluated.  For example, given a program `nessewnnnewwwsswse` and an iteration count of `5`, your interpreter should evaluate `nesse` before returning the final state of the data grid.  **Non-command characters should not count towards the number of iterations.**\n- Regarding iterations, the act of skipping to the matching `]` when a `[` is encountered (or vice versa) is considered to be **one** iteration regardless of the number of command characters in between.  The next iteration then commences at the command **right after** the matching `]` (or `[`).\n- Your interpreter should terminate normally and return the final state of the 2D data grid whenever **any** of the mentioned conditions become true: (1) All commands have been considered left to right, or (2) Your interpreter has already performed the number of iterations specified in the second argument.\n- The return value of your interpreter should be a representation of the final state of the 2D data grid where each row is separated from the next by a CRLF (`\\r\\n`).  For example, if the final state of your datagrid is\n\n```\n[\n  [1, 0, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0],\n  [0, 0, 1]\n]\n```\n\n... then your return string should be `\"100\\r\\n010\\r\\n001\"`.\n\nGood luck :D\n\n## Kata in this Series\n\n1.

        "question": "Vasya’s elder brother Petya loves playing computer games. In one of his favourite computer games Petya reached the final level where a fight with the boss take place.\n\nWhile playing the game Petya found spell scrolls and now he is about to use them. Let’s describe the way fighting goes on this level:\n\n1) The boss has two parameters: max — the initial amount of health and reg — regeneration rate per second.\n\n2) Every scroll also has two parameters: powi — spell power measured in percents — the maximal amount of health counted off the initial one, which allows to use the scroll (i.e. if the boss has more than powi percent of health the scroll cannot be used); and dmgi the damage per second inflicted upon the boss if the scroll is used. As soon as a scroll is used it disappears and another spell is cast upon the boss that inflicts dmgi of damage per second upon him until the end of the game.\n\nDuring the battle the actions per second are performed in the following order: first the boss gets the damage from all the spells cast upon him, then he regenerates reg of health (at the same time he can’t have more than max of health), then the player may use another scroll (no more than one per second).\n\nThe boss is considered to be defeated if at the end of a second he has nonpositive ( ≤ 0) amount of health.\n\nHelp Petya to determine whether he can win with the set of scrolls available to him and if he can, determine the minimal number of seconds he needs to do it.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers N, max and reg (1 ≤ N, max, reg ≤ 1000) –– the amount of scrolls and the parameters of the boss. The next N lines contain two integers powi and dmgi each — the parameters of the i-th scroll (0 ≤ powi ≤ 100, 1 ≤ dmgi ≤ 2000). \n\nOutput\n\nIn case Petya can’t complete this level, output in the single line NO.\n\nOtherwise, output on the first line YES. On the second line output the minimal time after which the boss can be defeated and the number of used scrolls. In the next lines for each used scroll output space-separated number of seconds passed from the start of the battle to the moment the scroll was used and the number of the scroll. Scrolls are numbered starting from 1 in the input order. The first scroll is considered to be available to be used after 0 seconds.\n\nOutput scrolls in the order they were used. It is not allowed to use scrolls after the boss is defeated.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n2 10 3\n100 3\n99 1\n\n\nOutput\n\nNO\n\n\nInput\n\n2 100 10\n100 11\n90 9\n\n\nOutput\n\nYES\n19 2\n0 1\n10 2",

This function takes `prices` and `n` as input, where `prices` is a list of stock prices over `n` days, and it returns the maximum profit that can be earned. We'll initialize two lists, `curr` and `nex`, to store the profit for the current and next day.\n\n[Pseudo Start]\n```\nFunction maximumProfit(prices, n):\n    Initialize list curr with two zeros\n    Initialize list nex with two zeros\n    Initialize variable profit to 0\n    Loop over the days from the last day to the first day:\n        Loop over the buy action from 0 to 1:\n            If buying:\n                Calculate profit when buying now\n                Calculate profit when not buying\n                Update profit to be the maximum of buying now or not buying\n            Else:\n                Calculate profit when selling now\n                Calculate profit when not selling\n                Update profit to be the maximum of selling now or not selling\n            Update curr with the profit for the current buy action\n        Update nex to be the current day's profit\n    Return the profit for not holding a stock on the first day\n[Pseudo End]\n```\n\nStep 2: <Action 2> Refine part of the pseudocode\nLet's refine the loop logic and the profit calculations. For each day, we need to decide whether to buy or sell. If we choose to buy, we subtract the price of the stock and add the profit from selling it on a future day. If we choose not to buy, we simply take the profit from the next day. The same logic applies for selling.\n\n[Pseudo Start]\n```\nFunction maximumProfit(prices, n):\n    Initialize list curr with two zeros\n    Initialize list nex with two zeros\n    Initialize variable profit to 0\n    For ind from n-1 down to 0:\n        For buy from 0 to 1:\n            If buy == 1:\n                buynow = -prices[ind] + nex[0]\n                notbuy = nex[1]\n                profit = max(buynow, notbuy)\n            Else:\n                sellnow = prices[ind] + nex[1]\n                notsell = nex[0]\n                profit = max(sellnow, notsell)\n            curr[buy] = profit\n        nex = curr\n    Return nex[1]\n[Pseudo End]\n```\n\nStep 3: <Action 2> Refine part of the pseudocode\nWe optimize the space usage by updating `nex` to be equal to `curr` at the end of each outer loop iteration. This way, we only store the necessary values for the next decision, reducing space complexity.\n\n[Pseudo Start]\n```\nFunction maximumProfit(prices, n):\n    Initialize list curr with two zeros\n    Initialize list nex with two zeros\n    For ind from n-1 down to 0:\n        For buy from 0 to 1:\n            If buy == 1:\n                buynow = -prices[ind] + nex[0]\n                notbuy = nex[1]\n                profit = max(buynow, notbuy)\n            Else:\n                sellnow = prices[ind] + nex[1]\n                notsell = nex[0]\n                profit = max(sellnow, notsell)\n            curr[buy] = profit\n        nex = curr\n    Return nex[1]\n[Pseudo End]\n```\n\nStep 4: <Action 3> Generate python code from the pseudocode\nThe pseudocode is now ready to be translated into Python code.

Next m lines contain two names — the names of the volunteers who do not get on. The names in pair are separated with a single space. Each pair of volunteers who do not get on occurs exactly once. The strings are case-sensitive. All n names are distinct.\n\nOutput\n\nThe first output line should contain the single number k — the number of people in the sought team.

We'll define a function `optimalArray` which takes the number of elements `n` and a list `a` as input. The function will return a list of integers, representing the minimum operations for each index `i`. We'll initialize the result list `res` with zeros and then proceed to compute the necessary operations for each index.\n\n[Pseudo Start]  \n```\nFunction optimalArray(n, a):\n    Initialize result list res with n zeros\n    Initialize variable ind to 1\n    Loop through the array starting from i = 1 to n-1:\n        For each i, compute the required operations and update the result\n        Increment ind\n    Return the result list\n[Pseudo End]  \n\nStep 2: <Action 2> Refine part of the pseudocode  \nTo compute the minimum number of operations, for each index `i`, we need to make all elements from index `0` to `i` equal. The minimum number of operations to make the elements equal is minimized by choosing the median value. Since the array is already sorted, the median can be found at index `i//2`. The sum of operations can be derived from the differences between the elements and the median. We can add this result to the running total.\n\n[Pseudo Start]  \n```\nFunction optimalArray(n, a):\n    Initialize result list res with n zeros\n    For i = 1 to n-1:\n        median = a[i // 2]\n        res[i] = res[i - 1] + (a[i] - median)\n    Return res\n[Pseudo End]  \n\nStep 3: <Action 2> Refine part of the pseudocode  \nLet's now consider the computational efficiency of the algorithm. The key observation here is that the cost of adjusting all elements from `a[0]` to `a[i]` to the median can be calculated incrementally. We don't need to recompute the entire cost for each `i`; instead, we can derive the result from the previous value `res[i-1]`, adding the cost for the new element at `a[i]`. The median of the sorted subarray `a[0..i]` is simply the middle element at index `i//2`.\n\n[Pseudo Start]  \n```\nFunction optimalArray(n, a):\n    Initialize result list res with n zeros\n    For i = 1 to n-1:\n        median = a[i // 2]\n        res[i] = res[i - 1] + (a[i] - median)\n    Return res\n[Pseudo End]  \n\nStep 4: <Action 3> Generate python code from the pseudocode  \nWe can now convert the pseudocode into a Python implementation.
