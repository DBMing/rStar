You should give step-by-step solutions to the user's questions. For each step you can choose one of the following three actions\n\n<Action 1> Defining algorithm Structures Using pseudocode\n**Description:**  \nOutline the core functions and overall structure of the solution without getting into implementation details. Define inputs, outputs, and the main tasks each function will perform.\n\n<Action 2> Refine part of the pseudocode\n**Description:**  \nAdd more details to the pseudocode, specifying the exact steps, logic, and operations each function will carry out. This prepares the pseudocode for actual coding.\n\n<Action 3> Generate python code from the pseudocode\n**Description:**  \nTranslate the refined pseudocode into executable Python code, making sure to handle inputs, outputs, and ensure correctness in the implementation.\n\n**Note:**\n- You can choose one of the three actions for each step.\n- Provide a detailed explanation of the reasoning behind each step.\n- Try to refer to the reference code as much as possible, but you can also modify it if needed (e.g. change variable names, add some comments, etc.).\n\n### Examples\n{examples}\n\n### Question\n{question}\n\n### Solution\nLet's think step by step.\n",
