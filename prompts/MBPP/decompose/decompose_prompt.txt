When the original question is answerable, start the sub-question with "Now we can write a complete Python function to solve this question: <original question>.

Question 1: Write a function to convert camel case string to snake case string.
Question 1.1: What is camel case, and how does it differ from snake case?
Answer 1.1: Camel case is a naming convention where the first letter of each word is capitalized and no spaces or underscores are used, for example, camelCaseString. Snake case, on the other hand, uses all lowercase letters and underscores to separate words, for example, snake_case_string.
Question 1.2: How can we identify uppercase letters in a camel case string?
Answer 1.2: We can identify uppercase letters in a camel case string by checking if each character is uppercase using the isupper() method in Python.
Question 1.3: How can we construct a snake case string from a camel case string?
Answer 1.3: To construct a snake case string, we can iterate through each character in the camel case string. When we encounter an uppercase letter, we can prepend it with an underscore (_) and convert it to lowercase. For lowercase letters, we can add them directly to the new string.
Question 1.4: Now we can write a complete Python function to solve this question: Write a function to convert camel case string to snake case string.
Answer 1.4: Here’s the function that performs the conversion:
```python
def camel_to_snake(camel_str):
    snake_str = ''.join(['_' + char.lower() if char.isupper() else char for char in camel_str])
    return snake_str.lstrip('_')
```
The code is: [code_begin]def camel_to_snake(camel_str): \r\n snake_str = ''.join(['' + char.lower() if char.isupper() else char for char in camel_str]) \r\n return snake_str.lstrip('')[code_end].

Question 2: Write a Python function to check whether the length of the word is even or not.
Question 2.1: What is the requirement for the function to determine if the length of the word is even?
Answer 2.1: The function needs to calculate the length of the word and check if that length is divisible by 2. If it is, then the length is even. The answer is `len(word) % 2 == 0`.
Question 2.2: Now we can write a complete Python function to solve this question: How do we implement the length check in a function?
Answer 2.2: We can define a function that takes a word as an argument and returns whether the length is even. The implementation is as follows:
```python
def is_length_even(word):
    return len(word) % 2 == 0
```
The code is: [code_begin]def is_length_even(word):\r\n    return len(word) % 2 == 0[code_end].

Question 3: Write a function to remove an empty tuple from a list of tuples.
Question 3.1: What defines an empty tuple in Python?
Answer 3.1: An empty tuple is defined as a tuple with no elements, represented by (). The answer is ().
Question 3.2: How can we identify and remove empty tuples from a list of tuples?
Answer 3.2: We can filter the list by checking each tuple and excluding those that are empty. This can be done using a list comprehension that only includes non-empty tuples.
Question 3.3: Now we can write a complete Python function to solve this question: Write a function to remove an empty tuple from a list of tuples.
Answer 3.3: Here’s the function that removes empty tuples:
```python
def remove_empty_tuples(tuples_list):
    return [tup for tup in tuples_list if tup]
```
The code is: [code_begin]def remove_empty_tuples(tuples_list):\r\n return [tup for tup in tuples_list if tup][code_end].

Question 4: Write a python function to accept the strings which contains all vowels.
Question 4.1: What defines a string containing all vowels in the English alphabet?
Answer 4.1: A string contains all vowels if it includes the characters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' at least once, regardless of their case. The answer is that the string must include the vowels: {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}.
Question 4.2: How can we check if a string contains all the vowels?
Answer 4.2: We can convert the string to lowercase, then use a set to track the vowels found in the string. If the size of this set equals 5 (the number of vowels), the string contains all vowels.
Question 4.3: Now we can write a complete Python function to solve this question: Write a python function to accept the strings which contains all vowels.
Answer 4.3: Here’s the updated function that checks for the presence of all vowels and returns "accepted" or "not accepted":
```python
def contains_all_vowels(s):
    vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
    return "accepted" if vowels.issubset(set(s.lower())) else "not accepted"
```
The code is: [code_begin]def contains_all_vowels(s):\r\n vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}\r\n return "accepted" if vowels.issubset(set(s.lower())) else "not accepted"[code_end].
