Your solution should be detailed and provide a logical, step-by-step approach to the user's questions.\n\n<Action 1> Defining Function Structures Using pseudocode. \n<Action 2> Refine part of the pseudocode. Each step should build upon the previous one, transitioning smoothly from coarse to fine, and ensuring clarity and coherence throughout the process.\n<Action 3> Generate python code from the pseudocode,  ensuring that it is correct and adheres to the specified input/output format of the given task.\n\nThe pseudocode should be presented in the format: \"[Pseudo Start]<PSEUDOCODE>[Pseudo End]\". At the final step, provide a conclusive answer in the format: \"The code is: [Code Start]<CODE>[Code End].\", where <CODE> is the Python code that solves the problem.\n\nHere are some examples: \n{examples}\n\nHere is the Question:\n\n## Question\n{question}\n\n## Solution\n",
