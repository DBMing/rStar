One day Vadim told his friend following problem:\nGiven N points on a plane. Each point p is defined by it's two integer coordinates \u2014 p_{x} and p_{y}. The distance between points a and b is min(|a_{x} - b_{x}|, |a_{y} - b_{y}|). You should choose a starting point and make a route visiting every point exactly once, i.e. if we write down numbers of points in order you visit them we should obtain a permutation. Of course, overall distance walked should be as small as possible. The number of points may be up to 40.\n\n\"40? Maybe 20? Are you kidding?\" \u2013 asked Roman. \"No, it's not a joke\" \u2013 replied Vadim. So Roman had nothing to do, but try to solve this problem. Since Roman is really weak in problem solving and you are the only friend, except Vadim, with whom Roman can discuss challenging tasks, he has nobody else to ask for help, but you!\n\n------ Input ------ \n\nInput description.\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

The following N lines contain two space-separated integers each \u2014 coordinates of points. \n \n------ Output ------ \n\nOutput description.\nOutput the answer for every test case in a separate line. The answer for every test case is a permutation of length N. In case there are several solutions that lead to minimal distance walked, you should choose the lexicographically smallest one. Let P denote such permutation. To make output smaller, you should output H(P). H(P) = P_{1} xor P_{2} xor ... xor P_{N}.

The distance between points a and b is min(|a_{x} - b_{x}|, |a_{y} - b_{y}|).

Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.\n\nHowever, just as she finished rating all exhibitions, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items after one removed the lowest one. Fair enough.\n\n# Task\n\nGiven an array of integers, remove the smallest value. **Do not mutate the original array/list**. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.\n\nDon't change the order of the elements that are left.\n\n### Examples\n\n```python\nremove_smallest([1,2,3,4,5]) = [2,3,4,5]\nremove_smallest([5,3,2,1,4]) = [5,3,2,4]\nremove_smallest([2,2,1,2,1]) = [2,2,2,1]\n```", "completion": "### Step 1: **Defining Algorithm Structure (Action 1)**\n\n#### Goal:\n1. Understand the problem requirements:\n   - Remove the smallest element from the list.\n   - If there are duplicates, remove the one with the lowest index.\n   - Do not mutate the original list.\n2. Outline the main steps:\n   - Identify the smallest element.\n   - Create a new list excluding the identified smallest element.\n   - Return the new list.\n\n#### Pseudocode:\n```pseudo\nFunction remove_smallest(arr):\n    If arr is empty:\n        Return an empty list\n    \n    Find the smallest element in arr\n    Find the index of the first occurrence of the smallest element\n    Create a new list excluding the identified element\n    Return the new list\n```\n\n### Step 2: **Refine Finding the Smallest Element (Action 2)**\n\n#### Goal:\n1. Determine the smallest element in the list.\n2. Identify the first occurrence of this smallest element.\n\n#### Pseudocode:\n```pseudo\nFunction find_smallest_and_index(arr):\n    If arr is empty:\n        Return None, None\n    \n    Initialize smallest as arr[0] and index as 0\n    For each element in arr starting from the second element:\n        If the element is smaller than smallest:\n            Update smallest and index\n    Return smallest, index\n```\n\n### Step 3: **Removing the Identified Element (Action 2)**\n\n#### Goal:\n1. Exclude the identified smallest element from the list.\n2. Ensure the order of remaining elements is maintained.\n\n#### Pseudocode:\n```pseudo\nFunction remove_element(arr, index):\n    Create a new list by concatenating elements before and after the specified index\n    Return the new list\n```\n\n### Step 4: **Combine All Steps (Action 2)**\n\n#### Goal:\n1. Integrate all previous steps into a cohesive pseudocode that fulfills the task requirements.\n\n#### Pseudocode:\n```pseudo\nFunction remove_smallest(arr):\n    If arr is empty:\n        Return an empty list\n    \n    smallest, index = find_smallest_and_index(arr)\n    Return remove_element(arr, index)\n```\n\n### Step 5: **Generate Python Code (Action 3)**\n\n#### Goal:\n1. Translate the refined pseudocode into executable Python code.\n2. Ensure the code adheres to the constraints and edge cases.\n\n#### Python Code:\n```python\ndef remove_smallest(arr):\n    if not arr:\n        return []\n\n    # Helper function to find the smallest element and its index\n    def find_smallest_and_index(arr):\n        smallest = arr[0]\n        index = 0\n        for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n            if arr[i] < smallest:\n                smallest = arr[i]\n                index = i\n        return smallest, index\n\n    # Helper function to remove the element at a specific index\n    def remove_element(arr, index):\n        return arr[:index] + arr[index + 1:]\n\n    smallest, index = find_smallest_and_index(arr)\n    return remove_element(arr, index)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(remove_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: [2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(remove_smallest([5, 3, 2, 1, 4]))  # Output: [5, 3, 2, 4]\nprint(remove_smallest([2, 2, 1, 2, 1]))  # Output: [2, 2, 2, 1]\n```\n\n### Final Explanation\nIn this solution, we first defined the high-level structure of the problem. We outlined the steps to identify the smallest element, remove it, and ensure the original list remains unchanged. Subsequently, we refined our pseudocode to include detailed logic for each step, such as finding the smallest element and its index, and removing the element from the list without mutating the original list. Finally, we implemented this logic in Python, ensuring it handled all edge cases, such as an empty list, and produced the correct output based on the provided examples.\n\n"}, {"prompt": "### Instruction\nPlease refer to the given task description and provide a thought process in the form of step-by-step pseudocode refinement.\n\nA curious user has approached you with a programming question.

Break down the solution into manageable functions and specify their responsibilities.\n\n#### Pseudocode:\n```pseudo\nFunction maxSquareSize(k, testCases):\n    For each testCase in testCases:\n        n = Length of the plank sizes\n        plankSizes = Array of plank sizes\n        Compute the maximum possible square size using computeMaxSquare(n, plankSizes)\n        Print the result\n\nFunction computeMaxSquare(n, plankSizes):\n    Sort plankSizes in descending order\n    For each possible side length s from n down to 1:\n        If there exist at least s planks of size >= s:\n            Return s\n    Return 1  // Minimum possible square size\n```\n\n### Step 2: **Refining Part of the Pseudocode (Action 2)**\n\n#### Goal:\nExpand the `computeMaxSquare` function to include the sorting step and logic to check if there are enough planks of the required size.\n\n#### Pseudocode:\n```pseudo\nFunction computeMaxSquare(n, plankSizes):\n    Sort plankSizes in descending order\n    For each possible side length s from n down to 1:\n        Initialize count = 0\n        For each plank in plankSizes:\n            If plank >= s:\n                Increment count\n            If count >= s:\n                Return s\n    Return 1  // Minimum possible square size\n```\n\n### Step 3: **Generate Python Code from the Pseudocode (Action 3)**\n\n#### Goal:\nTranslate the refined pseudocode into executable Python code, handling input and output correctly.\n\n#### Python Code:\n```python\ndef max_square_size(k, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for testCase in test_cases:\n        n = len(testCase[1])\n        plank_sizes = testCase[1]\n        max_side = compute_max_square(n, plank_sizes)\n        results.append(max_side)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\ndef compute_max_square(n, plank_sizes):\n    plank_sizes.sort(reverse=True)\n    for s in range(n, 0, -1):\n        count = 0\n        for plank in plank_sizes:\n            if plank >= s:\n                count += 1\n            if count >= s:\n                return s\n    return 1\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nk = int(data[0])\ntest_cases = []\n\nindex = 1\nfor _ in range(k):\n    n = int(data[index])\n    plank_sizes = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + n]))\n    test_cases.append([n, plank_sizes])\n    index += 1 + n\n\nmax_square_size(k, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis Python code reads the input, processes each test case to determine the maximum possible square size, and prints the results. The logic ensures that the planks are sorted in descending order, and it checks for the largest possible square size by iterating from the largest possible side length down to 1.\n\n"}]
